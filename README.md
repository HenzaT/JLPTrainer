# JLPTrainer - Japanese language flashcard app (for JLPT)
This is a self-directed project. This is a project intended to consolidate my ongoing learning of React.js and TypeScript.

## Goals
As I am half Japanese, I am fluent in Japanese but have never taken the Japanese language exam, the JLPT; it is something I'd like to do in the near future. Whilst working through the Scrimba React course, I had the idea to build a flashcard app to help me revise, as I thought React sounded perfect for it. This app will go through many iterations - features will be continuously integrated as I learn more about the React ecosystem and best practices. 

## Tech Stack
- React.js
- TypeScript
- Vite

## Process
I first set up my React project using Vite: 

`npm create vite@latest`\
Selected framework: `React`\
Selected variant: `TypeScript`\
`cd JLPTrainer`\
`npm install`\
`npm run dev`

As always with my projects, I started with a sketch of what I wanted the app to look like, and labelled components and some basic functionality. As components are absolutely vital in React, the sketch will help with the intial build (apologies for the rushed and messy kanji)

## Future Additions
As I am working through a react course, I still need to work out how to:
- get the kanji data from kanjiapi. I know that I will need to use a react hook like useEffect, but I have not come across it yet in a lesson.
- render child components within parent components.
