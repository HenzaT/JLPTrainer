# JLPTrainer - Japanese language flashcard app for JLPT exam
This is a self-directed project. This is a project intended to consolidate my ongoing learning of React.js and TypeScript.

## Goals
As I am half Japanese, I am fluent in Japanese but have never taken the Japanese language exam, the JLPT; it is something I'd like to do in the near future. Whilst working through the Scrimba React course, I had the idea to build a flashcard app as I thought React would be perfect for it. This app will go through many iterations - features will be continuously integrated as I learn more about the React ecosystem and best practices. 

## Tech Stack
- React.js
- TypeScript
- Vite

## Process
I first set up my React project using Vite: 

`npm create vite@latest`
